# Store

The system presents two interfaces-

Manager interface - from which you can send messages to registered customers, track sales, revenue and expenses.
Also loading the products from a database, adding, removing, replacing them.
The UNDO operation will support the cancellation of replacement or addition of products 
(cancellations are multiple and documented from the moment the program is run), a searched line in the table by code number and product name.

Customer interface - where you can see the shopping cart and the list of products that have not yet been purchased -
add and remove groceries, product search, payment, removal from the customer list, addition to the list of customer members
(who receive notifications of discounts in the store).

**In this project we can see an Implementation in:**
**Observer pattern, Singleton pattern, Iterator pattern, Memento pattern, Command pattern, MVC pattern, threads.**
